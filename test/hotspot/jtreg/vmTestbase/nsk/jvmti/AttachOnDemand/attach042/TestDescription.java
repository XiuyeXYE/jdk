 * @summary converted from VM Testbase nsk/jvmti/AttachOnDemand/attach042.
 * VM Testbase keywords: [jpda, jvmti, noras, feature_282, vm6, jdk]
 * VM Testbase readme:
 * Description :
 *     Test tries to load jvmti agent to the VM after the VM has started using
 *     Attach API (com.sun.tools.attach).
 *     Test is based on the nsk.share.aod framework. In the terms of this framework
 *     java application running in the VM where agent is loaded to is called 'target application'.
 *     Test checks that loaded agent can use JVMTI function GetThreadState.
 *     Test scenario:
 *         - during initialization agent enables ThreadStart events
 *         - target application starts thread
 *         - agent receives ThreadStart event for this thread and tries to call GetThreadState for
 *         all VM threads (agent just checks that function GetThreadState doesn't fail)
